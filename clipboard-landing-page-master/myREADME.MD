## WELCOME!

Thanks for checking out my own design that was challenged by frontend mentor you can check more challenges on ( www.frontendmentor.io )

## ðŸ›  SKILLS

HTML AND CSS.

## LESSONS LEARNED

I tested my skills on html and css...which i imroved on how to do a 5 column footer layout and improved on my skills on flexbox and media queries.
i faced some challenges while doing this project which are
. making sure the background image of the icon is responsive and making sure the background image covers the whole width
so while i was facing this i went ahead to w3schools.
w3schools is a good platform on how to learn different programming languages
